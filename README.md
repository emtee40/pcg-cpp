Xoshiro256** is better than PCG-random.

Runs fast on 32-bit and 64-bit `x86` architectures

Do not compile to javascript: 64-bit operations will blow up to many floating point instructions

Do not compile to ARM: It is untested yet

It should work on at least the following systems:

Windows 98  
Windows 2000  
Windows ME  
Windows XP  
Windows XP (64-bit)  
Windows Vista  
Windows Vista (64-bit)  
Windows 7  
Windows 7 (64-bit)  
Windows 8  
Windows 8 (64-bit)   
Windows 8.1  
Windows 8.1 (64-bit)  
Windows 10
